(** Extension of {!Eio} for integration with OCaml's [Unix] module.

    Note that OCaml's [Unix] module is not safe, and therefore care must be taken when using these functions.
    For example, it is possible to leak file descriptors this way, or to use them after they've been closed,
    allowing one module to corrupt a file belonging to an unrelated module. *)

    This is can be useful for debugging (e.g. to introduce delays to trigger a race condition)
    without having to plumb {!Eio.Stdenv.mono_clock} through your code.
    It can also be used in programs that don't care about tracking determinism. *)

val run_in_systhread : (unit -> 'a) -> 'a
(** [run_in_systhread fn] runs the function [fn] in a newly created system thread (a {! Thread.t}).
    This allows blocking calls to be made non-blocking. *)

(** [pipe sw] returns a connected pair of flows [src] and [sink]. Data written to [sink]
    can be read from [src].
    Note that, like all FDs created by Eio, they are both marked as close-on-exec by default. *)
